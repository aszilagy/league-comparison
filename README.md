# RiotApp (v0.1)
This app utilizes flask and Riot's API to create a tournament lobby in League of Legends and continually monitor data including player team, amount of games played, and player statistics. This is an early prototype and is utilizing the tournament-stub API, which emulates each of these events. 

## Takeaways
* Flask is used to create a web interface. Understanding is required of how flask interacts with templates and HTTP Methods.
* A config file is used (.ini) that includes my Riot API key and an encrypted username/password. These can be modified to suit a developers requirements.

**Note:** This is a personal application not designed for commercial or widespread use. The code needs improvement and this is an initial draft of the application.
