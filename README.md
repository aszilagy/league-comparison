# League-Comparison (v0.1)
This app utilizes flask and Riot's API to compare two League of Legends players and display a comparison of the player(s) statistics. This project is currently a work-in-progress and is in it's early stages.

## Takeaways
* Flask is used to create a web interface. Understanding is required of how flask interacts with templates and HTTP Methods.
* A config file is used (.ini) that includes my Riot API key and an encrypted username/password. These can be modified to suit a developers requirements.

**Note:** This is a personal application not designed for commercial or widespread use. The code needs improvement and this is an initial draft of the application.
